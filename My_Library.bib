The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early {NISQ} algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.},

	abstract = {The new and rapidly growing field of circuit {QED} offers extremely exciting prospects for learning about and exercising intimate control over quantum systems, providing flexible, engineerable design and strong nonlinearities and interactions in systems consisting of microwave radiation fields and fixed artificial "atoms". These notes aim to provide a non-expert introduction to the field of circuit {QED}, to give a basic appreciation of the promise and challenges of the field, along with a number of key concepts that will hopefully be useful for the reader who is new to the field and beginning to explore the research literature. They were written as a pedagogical text designed to complement a course delivered to third-year undergraduate students. After a introductory section which discusses why studying circuit {QED} might be worthwhile and interesting, I introduce the basic theory tools from quantum optics and quantum information which are needed to understand the key elements of circuit {QED}. I also provide a brief overview of superconductivity, focussing on the concepts which are most relevant to operation in the regimes of interest in circuit {QED}. I then describe the three main types of superconducting qubits, and finally give a basic introduction to decoherence and mixture and how they relate to quantum behaviour in electronic circuits.},

	abstract = {Quantum error correction ({QEC}) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early {NISQ} algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.},

These notes aim to provide a non-expert introduction to the field of circuit {QED}, to give a basic appreciation of the promise and challenges of the field, along with a number of key concepts that will hopefully be useful for the reader who is new to the field and beginning to explore the research literature. They were written as a pedagogical text designed to complement a course delivered to third-year undergraduate students. After a introductory section which discusses why studying circuit {QED} might be worthwhile and interesting, I introduce the basic theory tools from quantum optics and quantum information which are needed to understand the key elements of circuit {QED}. I also provide a brief overview of superconductivity, focussing on the concepts which are most relevant to operation in the regimes of interest in circuit {QED}. I then describe the three main types of superconducting qubits, and finally give a basic introduction to decoherence and mixture and how they relate to quantum behaviour in electronic circuits.},

	abstract = {Quantum error correction ({QEC}) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

For quantum information processing and quantum optics, an interesting regime of circuit {QED} is the dispersive regime, where the detuning between the qubit transition frequency and the resonator frequency is much larger than the interaction strength. In this paper, we investigate how non-linear corrections to the dispersive regime affect the measurement process. We find that in the presence of pure qubit dephasing, photon population of the resonator used for the measurement of the qubit act as an effective heat bath, inducing incoherent relaxation and excitation of the qubit. Measurement thus induces both dephasing and mixing of the qubit, something that can reduce the quantum non-demolition aspect of the readout. Using quantum trajectory theory, we show that this heat bath can induce quantum jumps in the qubit state and reduce the achievable signal-to-noise ratio of a homodyne measurement of the voltage.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous emission through a coupled cavity can be a significant decay channel for qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a circuit design that effectively eliminates spontaneous emission due to the Purcell effect while maintaining strong coupling to a low-Q cavity. Excellent agreement over a wide range in frequency is found between measured qubit relaxation times and the predictions of a circuit model. Using fast (nanosecond time-scale) flux biasing of the qubit, we demonstrate in situ control of qubit lifetime over a factor of 50. We realize qubit reset with 99.9\% fidelity in 120 ns.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic signals are always composed of photons, though in the circuit domain those signals are carried as voltages and currents on wires, and the discreteness of the photon's energy is usually not evident. However, by coupling a superconducting qubit to signals on a microwave transmission line, it is possible to construct an integrated circuit where the presence or absence of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. This system is called circuit quantum electrodynamics ({QED}) because it is the circuit equivalent of the atom-photon interaction in cavity {QED}. Previously, circuit {QED} devices were shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit can absorb and re-emit a single photon many times. Here, we report a circuit {QED} experiment which achieves the strong dispersive limit, a new regime of cavity {QED} in which a single photon has a large effect on the qubit or atom without ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the qubit transition can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of the probability to find the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This effect has been used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields and could be used to create a photon statistics analyzer. Since no photons are absorbed by this process, one should be able to generate non-classical states of light by measurement and perform qubit-photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.},
